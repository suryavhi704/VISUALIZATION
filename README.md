ğŸ“Š ILP Data Visualization using Python:
ğŸš€ About the Project
This project focuses on visualizing the ILP dataset using powerful Python libraries. With an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach, various statistical insights have been derived using different types of plots such as bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and more.

ğŸ“Œ Key Features:
âœ… Data Handling: Used pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
âœ… Stunning Visualizations: Created a variety of plots using matplotlib and seaborn.
âœ… Exploratory Insights: Showcased patterns and trends within the ILP dataset.

ğŸ“Š Visualizations Used:
ğŸ“Œ Bar Plot â€“ To compare categorical data.
ğŸ“Œ Pie Chart â€“ To show proportions within categories.
ğŸ“Œ Histogram â€“ To analyze distribution patterns.
ğŸ“Œ Box Plot â€“ To detect outliers and spread of data.
ğŸ“Œ Heatmap â€“ To represent correlations effectively.
